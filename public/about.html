<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a web design enthusiast who has been hooked on computers since the age of three. My first computer was an Apple IIc, 
  and I’ve been fascinated by technology ever since. I’ve lived all over the world and have developed a deep appreciation 
  for different cultures and ways of life. My passion for technology has led me to explore ways to apply automation to our 
  daily lives, freeing up more time to be better people to those around us.</p>

<p>As I learn HTML, I’m excited to continue exploring the world of web design and development. I’m eager to learn new skills 
  and techniques that will help me create beautiful, functional websites that make a difference in people’s lives. Whether 
  it’s designing a site for a small business or creating an online platform for a nonprofit organization, I’m committed to 
  using my skills to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
